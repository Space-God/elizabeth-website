		<h3><b>Elizabeth Conlin was born in New Ipswich, New Hampshire and later moved to Portland
		, Maine and will receive her BFA in ceramics from Maine College of Art in 2017.  
		While Maine is now technically home, she has traveled and hiked throughout the country and 
		draws from these experiences when creating forms and installations.  Using raw and fired 
		clay, along with a variety of other materials, Elizabeth attempts to create large installation 
		pieces that call to mind prehistoric creatures and unfamiliar landscapes.  Elizabeth work with
		 many different sizes and in many different ways to create each aspect of these slightly
		 unsettling environments.</b></h3>
